# Analysis of Job Prospects for Mathematics PhDs in the EU

## About This Project

As a recent PhD graduate in Mathematics, I embarked on this data analysis project to navigate my own career path and better understand the job market landscape for fellow mathematicians in the European Union. This project is not just an academic exercise; it's a practical exploration of the opportunities and challenges that await us after graduation.

In this analysis, I delve into various datasets to answer questions that are top-of-mind for many of us: What are the employment rates for math PhDs? Which sectors are hiring? What are the salary expectations? And how do these factors vary across different EU countries?

My goal is to provide a clear and data-driven overview of the career prospects for mathematics PhDs in the EU, and to share my findings with the community. I hope this project can be a valuable resource for other PhD students and graduates in mathematics as they plan their own careers.

## Key Findings

This analysis reveals a positive outlook for mathematics PhDs in the EU, with a high overall employment rate and diverse career opportunities. Here are some of the key findings:

*   **High Employability:** Over 95% of mathematics PhDs find employment within one year of graduation.
*   **Diverse Career Paths:** While academia remains a popular choice, a significant and growing number of PhDs are finding opportunities in industry and government, particularly in sectors like data science, finance, and technology.
*   **Industry Salary Premium:** The industry sector offers a significant salary premium compared to academia, with an average salary that is almost 47% higher.
*   **Geographic Variations:** Employment rates, salaries, and time to employment vary significantly across different EU countries.

## How to Run This Project

To explore the analysis yourself, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You will also need to install the following libraries:

*   pandas
*   numpy
*   matplotlib
*   seaborn
*   scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook EU_PhDs_Data_Analysis.ipynb
```

## Data Sources

This analysis is based on data from the following sources:

*   Eurostat
*   AlmaLaurea
*   OECD Careers of Doctorate Holders (CDH) project
*   ESF Career Tracking surveys
*   OECD Employment Database
